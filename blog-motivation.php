        <h1>How to be motivated to train all the time?</h1>
        <p>Staying motivated to exercise can be a challenge, especially if you're just starting out or if you're in a fitness rut. But staying active is important for both your physical and mental health, so it's worth it to find ways to stay motivated. Here are some tips to help you stay motivated to exercise:</p>
        <p>1. Set achievable goals. It's important to have goals to strive for, but make sure they're realistic. If your goals are too lofty, you may get discouraged if you don't see progress as quickly as you'd like. Start with smaller, achievable goals and work your way up to bigger ones.</p>

        <p>3. Find a workout buddy. Having someone to exercise with can make workouts more fun and give you accountability. Plus, it's always more enjoyable to have someone to chat with while you're sweating it out.</p>
